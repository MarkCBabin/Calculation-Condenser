# Calculation-Condenser
These series of python and bash scripts are intended to allow for the queuing of jobs using Gaussian or QChem and to automatically read the outputs to determine 1) if the calculation finished correctly and 2) if so, to condense the relevant information into a short .txt file. 


Currently these are limited to DFT calculations of geometry optimizations and frequency calculations (my most commonly performed calculations).
